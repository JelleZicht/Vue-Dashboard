# Vue-Dashboard to run
- npm install
- npm start

A simple dashboard to learn more about setting up npm projects and the workings of Vuejs.

Step 1:
Create a project including the following features/packages:
- Vue.js as main logic framework.
- Typescript as improvement (superset) for  Javascript.
- Sass as improvement (pre-processor) for  css.
- Including minification of js and css.
- Prefixing of css.
- Bundling css.
- Bundling js.
- Bootstrap or ZSS as styling framework and basic styling configurations.
- Watchers to compile files on change.
- Browsersync to update the browser automatically.
- Webpack to resolve dependencies between modules in Typescript files.
- Add a package to check if css classes aren't used anymore, to test if it is use-able for larger projects.
- Clean and create directory commands.
- Init command for React.
- Init command for Vue.
- JQuery, Popper and Autoprefixer are required by other libraries. Clean up libraries.

Webpack can probably be used to cover more tasks that are currently separated over multiple different packages;
Typescript and sass compilation, watching, bundling and minification.

Todo: Clean up all the packages + more efficient. Also consider adding more features.
  
Step 2:
Build a basic dashboard once all technicalities are solid.

Step 3:
Optimize the build and automate the build process.

Step 4: 
Ask people kindly for feedback and more ideas to implement into this project that would actually be usefull to find out.
