# Vue-Dashboard
A simple dashboard to learn more about setting up npm projects and the workings of Vuejs.

Step 1:
Create a project including the following features/packages:
- Vue.js as main logic framework.
- Typescript and Sass as improvement for (superset & pre-processor) Javascript and Sass.
- Bootstrap or ZSS as styling framework and basic styling configurations.
- Watchers to compile files on change and Browserlync to update the browser automatically.
- Webpack to resolve dependancies between modules in Typescript files.
- Juery, Popper and Autoprefixer are required by other libraries, can clean this up later.
- Add a package to check if css classes arent used anymore, to test if it is useable for larger projects.

Webpack can probably be used to cover more tasks that are currently separated over multiple different packages;
Typescript and sass compilation, watching, bundling and minification.

Todo: Clean up all the packages + more efficient. Also consider adding more features.
  
Step 2:
Build a basic dashboard once all technicalities are solid.

Step 3:
Optimize the build and automate the build process.

Step 4: 
Ask people kindly for feedback and more ideas to implement into this project that would actually be usefull to find out.
